If the installation fails for some reason, you can still do it manually.

1. Execute `install.sql` to your database. If you dont have a DB manager I recommend HeidiSQL.

2. Go to script/database/ and create a file `config.php` with the following content:

<?php 
              $user="WRITE_ROOT_HERE";
              $pass="WRITE PASSWORD HERE";
              $auth="WRITE AUTH DB NAME HERE";
              $chars="WRITE CHARACTERS DB NAME HERE";
?>

3. Edit `.htaccess` file content to: 

DirectoryIndex manage.php

4. Execute this query to your database in order to create your own account:

use launcher;
replace into security (user, password) values("YOUR USERNAME","YOUR PASSWORD");

5. Delete the `index.php` file
